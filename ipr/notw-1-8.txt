Problem with the alternator could be a failed diode (failed closed).
If it is replacting the alternator rectifier will fix it, if not it could be a problem with the regulator. Not sure though, testing it will give a better answer than my guess.
Just hoping that if a diode has failed closed it hasn't recked the battery, but again testing it will say more than me guessing.
